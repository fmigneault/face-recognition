    ORIGINAL REFERENCE
    ==================

    Tracker based on Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) [1] and Circulant Structure with Kernels (CSK) [2].
    CSK is implemented by using raw gray level features, since it is a single-channel filter.
    KCF is implemented by using HOG features (the default), since it extends CSK to multiple channels.

    Constructor parameters, all boolean:
        hog: use HOG features (default), otherwise use raw pixels
        fixed_window: fix window size (default), otherwise use ROI size (slower but more accurate)
        multiscale: use multi-scale tracking (default; cannot be used with fixed_window = true)

    Default values are set for all properties of the tracker depending on the above choices.
    Their values can be customized further before calling init():
        interp_factor: linear interpolation factor for adaptation
        sigma: gaussian kernel bandwidth
        lambda: regularization
        cell_size: HOG cell size
        padding: horizontal area surrounding the target, relative to its size
        output_sigma_factor: bandwidth of gaussian target
        template_size: template size in pixels, 0 to use ROI size
        scale_step: scale step for multi-scale estimation, 1 to disable it
        scale_weight: to downweight detection scores of other scales for added stability

    For speed, the value (template_size/cell_size) should be a power of 2 or a product of small prime numbers.

    Inputs to init():
    image is the initial frame.
    roi is a cv::Rect with the target positions in the initial frame

    Inputs to update():
    image is the current frame.

    Outputs of update():
    cv::Rect with target positions for the current frame
